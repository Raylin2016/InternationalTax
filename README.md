# Ray Lin's Blog

## About Me

Hello, my name is Ray Lin. I'm a rising 3L JD student at Cornell Law and a proud alumnus of Tsinghua University.

## Introduction

Welcome to my International Tax Code Blog. I've always been passionate about how technology can be applied to various fields, particularly law. I believe that tax law has a lot in common with programming - it's all about creating shortcuts according to the code. Whenever you need to trigger one part of the tax, you only need to use that shortcut.

## Purpose of This Blog

In this blog, I aim to demystify the complexities of tax law and share my innovative approach to tax analysis. I hope to bridge the gap between the legal profession and technology, and inspire others to view tax law from a unique perspective.

Whether you're a fellow law student, a legal professional, or simply someone interested in tax law, I hope this blog provides useful insights and provokes thoughtful discussion.

## Navigating this Blog

Each post on this blog will focus on a different aspect of international tax law, exploring it through the lens of technology and programming. I'll provide a breakdown of complex topics, creating 'shortcuts' for better understanding, and apply my insights to real-world examples.
